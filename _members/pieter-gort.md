Pieter C. Gort is a computer vision researcher at TU/e ARIA lab. His research focuses on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging, specifically for the detection and analysis of peritoneal metastases, a rare and aggressive form of cancer with low survival rates. Given the complexity of peritoneal metastases, traditional imaging techniques often struggle with accurate diagnosis and disease burden assessment. His work leverages deep learning and computer vision to enhance early detection, improve staging accuracy, and assist clinicians in treatment planning.
